# 1st-Project
<h1>Dear Future Me</h1>
<p>As I sit here Feb. 27, 2017 wondering what is in store for me as I take my 1st class tonight, I am super excited. I am excited to be learning something new and challenging myself past my normal comfort zone. And as I imagine what would I say to Amanda a few weeks from now when she is needing that extra push when she is feeling the pressure. I can only imagine myself saying something like</p>
<span>Hey you. Yes you. You are doing this. You are finally taking the next steps you never thought you would. Be proud that you have come this far. Don't let the stress or the pressure get to you now.</span>
<p> Are you stuck? Coming up empty? Take a step back, just breath and have fun. Don't let this get the best of you. If you need help ask. You have peers and forums to help you past this hump. Whatever you do don't give up. Keep pushing and imagine how great it will feel Feb. of 2018 and you have accomplished so much.</p>
<h1>Becoming a Web Developer is a personal goal.</h1>
<p>Just for me to better myself and to be better skilled in the work force. I also set it as a personal goal because my son Ryley who is 12 is fascinated with Web Development. He has been working with Coding and designing websites for 2 years. I love being able to learn something and share in his excitement and have conversations with him about something we both like. He makes me excited and ready to become a Web Developer.</p>
<bold>I am ready to rock this!</bold>
